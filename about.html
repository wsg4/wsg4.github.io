            <h2>I'm Billy, and I love design</h2>
            <p>I've been fascinated with web design and development since middle school. I remember building my very first website for a class - written in notepad, complete with frames, animated gifs, and awful background music. The internet has come a long way since then and I've been following that evolution ever since.</p>
            <p>After college, I began my professional career by redesigning my parish's website and managing our social media channels. From there, I was promoted to a diocesan position and worked closely with our webdev to completely redesign the diocesan website. I also assumed responsibility for my entire department's web presence and became their digital content manager.</p>
            <p>I am currently working for a neurotechnology software company as a product designer. Though I began as a business analyst, I quickly picked up design work in creating high-fidelity wireframes in UX Pin and Figma. I enjoy design and I enjoy helping people develop the best experience for their end users.</p>
